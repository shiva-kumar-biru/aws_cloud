# Cloud Computing

### What is Cloud computing?

It is the On-Demand delivery of compute power,database storage,applictaions and other IT resources.

Through a cloud services platform with **pay as you go** pricing


## Characteristics

* **On-demand self-service**: Users can provision and de-provision resources as needed.
* **Broad network access**: Resources are accessible over the internet from any device.
* **Resource pooling**: Resources are pooled together to provide a multi-tenant environment.
* **Rapid elasticity**: Resources can be quickly scaled up or down to meet changing business needs.
* **Measured service**: Users only pay for the resources they use.

## Service Models

* **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**
	+ Provides virtualized computing resources, such as:
		- Servers (e.g., Amazon EC2, Microsoft Azure Virtual Machines)
		- Storage (e.g., Amazon S3, Microsoft Azure Blob Storage)
		- Networking (e.g., Amazon VPC, Microsoft Azure Virtual Network)
	+ Users have full control over the infrastructure, but are responsible for managing it.
* **Platform as a Service (PaaS)**
	+ Provides a complete development and deployment environment for applications, including:
		- Tools (e.g., GitHub, Azure DevOps)
		- Frameworks (e.g., Ruby on Rails, Django)
		- Databases (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL)
	+ Users have control over the application and data, but not the underlying infrastructure.
* **Software as a Service (SaaS)**
	+ Provides software applications over the internet, such as:
		- Microsoft Office 365
		- Salesforce
	+ Users have no control over the underlying infrastructure or application, but can configure settings and customize the user interface.

## Deployment Models

### Public Cloud

* **Definition**: A third-party provider delivers cloud services over the internet.
* **Characteristics**:
	+ Scalability: Resources can be quickly scaled up or down to meet changing business needs.
	+ Cost-effective: Users only pay for the resources they use.
	+ Low maintenance: The provider is responsible for maintenance and upgrades.
* **Examples**: Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

### Private Cloud

* **Definition**: A single organization owns and manages its own cloud infrastructure.
* **Characteristics**:
	+ Control: The organization has full control over the infrastructure and data.
	+ Security: Data is stored on-premises, providing higher security.
	+ Customization: The infrastructure can be customized to meet specific business needs.
* **Examples**: VMware, OpenStack
### Hybrid Cloud

* **Definition**: A combination of public and private cloud services.
* **Characteristics**:
	+ Flexibility: Users can choose the best deployment model for each application.
	+ Scalability: Resources can be scaled up or down to meet changing business needs.
	+ Cost-effective: Users can take advantage of the cost benefits of public cloud services.
* **Examples**: AWS Outposts, Azure Stack.
